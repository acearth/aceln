When I installed Archlinux on my notebook which had been installed win7, I reboot the computer. But the GRUB interface is only one option, just for arch.
I resolved this problem by do operation below:
	pacman -S os-prober
	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
And  win7 appear again on GRUB startup interface.
